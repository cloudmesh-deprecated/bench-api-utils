 About
=======

This package provides an API and utilities for benchmarking various
cloud platforms.  The api is intended to support arbitrary benchmarks,
with a few constraints:

#. the actual code for a benchmark may live in its own repository and needs to be fetched
#. some environment needs to be prepared
#. a virtual cluster needs to be launched on a cloud provider
#. software needs to be deployed to the cluster, such as with ansible
#. a benchmark can be run on the cluster


The API is provided in `bench.py <./cloudmesh_bench_api/bench.py>`_
